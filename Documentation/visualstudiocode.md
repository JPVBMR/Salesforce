## Execute Anonymous Apex
> **Note** By default, a new project has a folder scripts/apex that contains an example hello.apex file. We recommend that you use this folder to create your Anonymous Apex files using the .apex file extension.
For further explanation go to [Tools for Writing Apex Code](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/apex/writing#:~:text=You%20can%20execute%20Anonymous%20Apex,entire%20context%20of%20a%20file.) 

You can execute Anonymous Apex in Visual Studio code in two ways:

1. Select any Apex code and run the command **SFDX: Execute Anonymous Apex with Currently Selected Text**.
2. Run the command **SFDX: Execute Anonymous Apex with Editor Contents to execute the entire context of a file**.

In both cases, the result of the executed code is printed to the output pane.
